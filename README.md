MLSP 2013 challenge


Targeted  MLSP 2013 Bird Species classification challenge using LSTM, BI-LSTM, VGG in Keras.
We took an image approach which involves converting audio waveforms into corresponding spectrograms
and then using the image recognition techniques to preform multi-label, multi-class classification
